# Memory PC Interface firmware

The aim of this project is design a board for share data and/or programs between a PC and Dragon Computer throw expansion bus. Using a 2KB Dual-Port SDRAM chip attatched to Dragon computer expansion bus and attatched to external AVR microcontroller for interact from PC and read or write data/programs to Dragon. 

Other purposes can reach a development card used for test programs developed with 6809 compiler directly to read hardware same as Dragon 32/64.
